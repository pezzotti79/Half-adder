the idea behind this repository is to demonstrate my understandings in binary addittion and showing how it is applied in a project

# Binary Addittion
Just like normal decimal addition, it is the process of adding two binary numbers together, but the  only two digits used in binary are 0 and 1, and when the sum is greater than  1, a carry is propagated to the next stage. Decimals work the same way, only  when the sum is more than 9; in base 10, 1+1 is  10, meaning 0 plus a carry of 1.
